This OS project is a teamwork, equally done by Mohit, Deepti and Sakshi.
The project "Real time os security event logger", is a system or tool that records security-related events and activities within a real-time operating system (RTOS).
It monitors and logs critical security information, such as user access, system calls, hardware interactions, and potential threats, in real-time.
The goal is to provide timely insights into security incidents, anomalies, or breaches, helping system administrators or security teams detect, analyze, and respond to potential security risks promptly.
These logs are crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of the system, especially in environments where reliability and fast response times are essential.
